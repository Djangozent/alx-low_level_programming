**0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings**

**Pointers:**

A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. It allows you to indirectly access the value 
stored in a particular memory location. Pointers are denoted by an asterisk *.

**Arrays:**

An array is a collection of entities of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. The elements in an array are accessed using an index.

**Strings:**

In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters. Strings are null-terminated, meaning they end with a special character \0 to signify the end of the string.
